Yes — the plan is good, but it’s optimistic.
£150k can work, but it leaves very little margin for reality.
If you want this to survive investor scrutiny and real-world friction, I’d improve the plan and strongly consider £200k–£250k instead.

Below I’ll explain why, what’s missing, and how I’d improve it, in plain English — grounded in your actual document, not theory. 

SnapNow Pre Seed Deployment Plan

1. Is the current £150k plan “bad”?

No. It’s actually well structured for pre-seed, especially because:

You already have a working MVP

You’re founder-led (no salary)

You’re leveraging AI + contractors

You’re doing phased city launches

Many pre-seed plans are far worse.

But… it assumes everything goes almost perfectly.

2. Where the plan is overly optimistic (important)
A. Mobile development is underpriced

You’ve allocated £55k total for:

4 months Lead React Native engineer (£32k)

3 months backend engineer (£18k)

Tools & stores (£5k) 

SnapNow Pre Seed Deployment Plan

Reality check (plain English):

One solid mobile engineer alone often costs £8–10k/month minimum

App Store review cycles cause delays

Push notifications, deep links, location services, background permissions → always take longer than planned

Bug-fixing after launch is guaranteed, not optional

👉 Risk: Month 4 slips to Month 6, but your plan assumes Month 4 apps live.

B. Marketing budget is thin for 5 cities

£40k across 5 global cities = £8k per city total.

That has to cover:

Photographer incentives

Events

Content

Referrals

Ads

That’s extremely tight, especially for:

London

NYC

Tokyo (localization + trust barriers)

👉 Risk: You get supply (photographers) but demand (customers) lags badly.

C. No explicit buffer for “platform trust” costs

What’s not explicitly budgeted:

Chargebacks / Stripe disputes

Fraud prevention tooling

Customer support surges

Photographer disputes

Emergency fixes during live bookings

These things don’t appear in spreadsheets… until they hit.

D. 15 months runway assumes revenue ramps smoothly

Your own numbers say:

2,500 bookings over 15 months

£32k platform revenue total 

SnapNow Pre Seed Deployment Plan

That’s fine for validation, but it doesn’t materially extend runway.

👉 Translation: You are still fully dependent on the £150k lasting the full 15 months.

Any delay shortens that fast.

3. The single biggest strategic issue: 5 cities is too many for pre-seed

This is the part investors will question.

At pre-seed, the goal is not coverage.
The goal is proof.

Right now you’re trying to prove:

Multi-sided marketplace

Cross-border expansion

Localization

Payments

Supply + demand

Brand trust

That’s a lot for £150k.

4. How I would improve the plan (concrete changes)
OPTION A — Same £150k, but smarter (lower risk)

Change:

Reduce from 5 cities → 2 cities

Example: London + Paris or London + NYC

Why this helps:

Marketing spend doubles per city

Operational complexity drops

Case study becomes much stronger

Investors care more about depth than breadth

How this looks in the deck:

“We intentionally limited pre-seed to two cities to maximize proof of unit economics and operational repeatability before expansion.”

That sounds smart, not small.

OPTION B — Keep 5 cities, raise more (£200k–£250k)

If you want the 5-city vision intact, I’d revise to:

Recommended raise: £225k

Rough reallocation:

Mobile + backend: £80k

Marketing: £65k

Team & ops: £45k

Buffer: £35k

Why investors won’t hate this:

You’re still lean

Still founder-led

Still milestone-driven

But now resilient to delays

This dramatically improves survival odds.

5. What investors really want to see (this matters)

At pre-seed, investors are asking:

Will this marketplace actually work in one place?

Can you acquire supply without burning cash?

Do users repeat bookings?

Does trust hold under pressure?

Can this be repeated city-by-city?

They do not need:

5 flags on a map

Perfect polish

Massive GMV yet

They need evidence.

6. My honest recommendation (clear and direct)

If this were my company:

I would either

Raise £150k for 2 cities

or

Raise £225k for 5 cities

What I would not do is:

Run 5 cities on £150k and hope nothing slips

Hope is not a strategy — and investors can smell it.
