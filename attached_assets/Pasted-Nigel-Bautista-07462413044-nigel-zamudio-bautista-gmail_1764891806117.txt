Work Profile:
I am an experienced Senior SDET / Software Engineer in Test. I have been working as an SDET for the last 12 years now, functioning as an all-rounder, covering all areas of testing, including Front-end, Back-end, and Automation, for Web and Mobile applications across different technologies.

My core expertise is in building, maintaining, and enhancing the CI/CD Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipeline. I specialize in shift-left methodology, ensuring quality is integrated from the earliest stages of development.

This involves:
* Pre-Merge Quality Gates: Implementing rigorous pre-merge checks using GitHub Actions and other tools (Jenkins, GitLab, Docker) that mandate all automated tests must pass before merging into the main branch, thus maintaining the integrity and stability of the production environment.
* Full-Stack Test Automation: Architecting and integrating multiple layers of automated testing (Unit, API/Integration, and End-to-End) directly into the CI/CD process to maximize test coverage and drastically reduce testing environments prior to production releases.
* Framework Leadership: Leading the development and setting the standards for robust testing frameworks using technologies like Playwright/Typescript and Cypress/Javascript, which accelerates testing and improves collaboration between development and quality teams.

My focus is on the analytical rigor necessary to scope every test scenario correctly, combined with the software engineering skills to make testing efficient through automation. I truly enjoy working with the latest technology and continuously learning how to be more efficient in the art of building reliable software.

Job Experiences:

Companies House:
Senior Software Engineer in Test (SDET), Started: August 2024 - (Current Job)
In my current role as a senior SDET, I'm a part of the migration team that is in charge of migrating the old tests from their old framework to the new framework. I am one of 5 people who leads the project and built the new framework from scratch and formed its architecture and at the same time set the standards for the new Playwright TS framework. My main daily task now is to migrate old Java Cucumber tests into our new Playwright TS framework.

Natter:
Principal Software Engineer in Test (SDET), Started: Jan 2024 - Aug 2024
* Focused on Real-World Testing: I shifted our testing strategy to concentrate more on how our products perform under actual user conditions. This shift helped us catch and fix issues that really matter to our users.
* Led a Skilled SDET Team: As the team lead for two other SDETs, I've focused on building a strong team that's deeply involved in our development process from start to finish. Together, we've set high standards for quality and worked closely with everyone involved to make sure we meet them.
* Developed a Custom Testing Framework: I introduced a new testing framework using Playwright and JavaScript/TypeScript, which made it easier for us to test our software more thoroughly and quickly. This tool is now a key part of how we work, helping us catch issues early and improve collaboration between our developers and SDET team.
* Improved Our CI/CD Pipeline: I took on the challenge of upgrading our CI/CD pipeline with better GitHub and GitHub Actions integration. This move has made our development process smoother and more reliable, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring that we can deliver high-quality software more consistently.
* Thanks to these efforts, Natter has made significant strides in how we develop software and ensure quality. We've become more efficient and agile, and I'm proud of the role I've played in making that happen.

Endeavor Streaming:
Senior Software Engineer in Test (SDET) Started: Feb 2022 - Jan 2024
In my role as Senior SDET, I have led a transformative shift towards a more agile and efficient software delivery process. My contributions include:
* Agile Methodology Implementation: Spearheaded the adoption of a "shift-left" approach, significantly enhancing collaboration between product and development teams. This initiative ensured a deeper, upfront understanding of project scopes, minimising misunderstandings and preventing potential issues early in the development lifecycle.
* Framework Development: Innovated by creating and implementing a proprietary end-to-end testing framework using Playwright and JavaScript/TypeScript. Initially housed in a separate repository, the framework was later integrated into the main application repository to streamline operations and improve developer collaboration.
* CI/CD Process Enhancement: Played a pivotal role in integrating our agile processes with the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub and GitHub Actions. This strategy includes a rigorous pre-merge check that ensures all test layers pass before merging into the master branch, thereby maintaining the integrity and stability of the production environment. This approach has not only bolstered our confidence in the software quality but also eliminated the necessity for multiple testing environments prior to production releases, yielding a significant increase in process efficiency.

Hopin:
Senior Software Engineer in Test (SDET), Aug 2020 - Jan 2022
* Led the shift-left methodology implementation amidst the company's hyper-growth, scaling the workforce from 50 to over 1000 employees within a year, and significantly enhancing the CI/CD process and product quality.
* Collaborated closely with product managers and designers to ensure quality was integrated at every stage of development, minimising risks and maximising product reliability.
* Managed the end-to-end automation suite, streamlining the testing process and ensuring green builds before development merges, contributing to the robustness of CI/CD goals.
