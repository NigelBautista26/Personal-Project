Right now we’re finally at a good baseline, so from here it’s more building features than fighting infrastructure 👌

Where you are

✅ Login → backend dev URL works

✅ Photographer with no profile goes to onboarding

✅ Photographer with existing profile (Anna) goes to dashboard

✅ Dashboard renders without context errors

✅ snapnowApi + apiClient paths are fixed

Suggested roadmap from here

I’d do things in this order:

1️⃣ Make the routing pattern match the Replit guide (clean + future-proof)

Goal: Login only logs in, and the photographer group layout decides where to go.

Concretely:

login.tsx

If user.role === "photographer" → router.replace("/(photographer)")

Else (customer/admin) → router.replace("/(customer)") (or temporarily /)

app/(photographer)/_layout.tsx

On mount, call:

snapnowApi.me() → confirm logged in and role === photographer

snapnowApi.mePhotographer() → profile status

Logic:

!profile → <Redirect href="/(photographer)/onboarding" />

profile.verificationStatus !== "verified" → pending screen

else → <Slot /> (dashboard, bookings, earnings, etc.)

That mirrors the web app and keeps all “where should a photographer land?” logic in one place.

2️⃣ Give customers a proper home flow

Right now customers just bounce back to the welcome screen.

Next:

app/(customer)/index.tsx – basic “Browse photographers” home

Later:

Photographer profile screen

Booking flow

“My bookings” screen

We can stub these with static UI first and plug the real endpoints in afterwards.

3️⃣ Add “bootstrap on app start” (auto-login)

So when you reopen the app:

Call snapnowApi.me() once on startup

If logged in:

If role = photographer → send into /(photographer)

Else → /(customer)

If not logged in → welcome screen

This makes the app feel like a real product instead of a demo.

4️⃣ Wire real data into dashboard / bookings / earnings

Once routing is solid:

Dashboard → real earnings + upcoming bookings

Bookings tab → /api/bookings data

Earnings tab → history from backend

If you want to keep going right now, the next concrete step I’d take is Step 1: clean login + photographer layout guard.
